Each space represents different place (Town, Fields, Forest, Desert,etc.). At the end of each turn, the player can perform selected action such as sleeping, searching for enemies, hunting. Many actions depends on the character classes, skills, and equipment. Srututu-Forgotten Foe The offers many opportunities and some skill connections may bring you great results (such as Hunting and Cooking). All depends on you and your strategy!

Why Board Game??

This game is very complex so it is not a typical board game that could be played without a computer. It is based on the fundamental principles of board games but it is 100% computer game.
Today, many of the games features randomly generated levels. Here the board is static but the player moves according to the dice results. It may seem that a lot depends on luck and the player skills are not important. That's not true. Everything depends on your choices.And the desired dice result gives a lot of happiness! ;D

Game features:

- 3 game modes
- over 500 items (528 various item icons)
- 75 skills and spells
- over 100 enemies
- 20 main quests
- hundreds of actions (trade, harvest, sleep, explore)
- 120 stars to collect
- over 100 improvements (new dungeon levels, new skills, more Hp)
- 6 playable characters (Warrior, Thief, Archer, Hunter, Mage, Priest)
- 25 laps to go
